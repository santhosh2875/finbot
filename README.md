Documents are:

-Chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

-Embedded using MiniLM

-Tagged with metadata (department, roles, access flags)

-Retrieved using LangChain retriever with role-based filtering



🛠️ Setup Instructions:
recommended python version:
----Python 3.11.0----------recommended

-----visual studio code-------recommended

🐍 1. Create  Virtual Environment
 
📦 Step 1: Open a terminal inside your project directory and run:

⚙️ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


🧪 2. Install Dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt


🔐 3. Configure .env
---.env file in the root directory of the project:

---Paste your OpenRouter API key into it like this:

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=paste your your_openrouter_key


  
📂 4. Ingest Documents into Chroma
 # ✅ This will generate the chroma_db folder from your markdown and CSV files

   python -m backend.ingest


▶️ How to Run the Project

🟢 1. Start Backend (FastAPI)
   
    uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload


🖥️ 2. Start Frontend (Streamlit)
    
    streamlit run frontend/app.py

    - Visit: http://localhost:8501




💬 Usage Example


Username: alice||bob||john||eve||dan||-- (any one!!)

password: password123

------------------
